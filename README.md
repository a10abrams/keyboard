## Virtual Keyboard
A JavaScript-based virtual keyboard with different themes and languages.

## Files
These are the files for the basic/single color keyboard:
- keyboardbase.html
- keybaordbase.css
- keyboardbase.js

The files that constitute other themes will follow the naming convention "[theme_name]_keyboard".

## Possible updates / idea dump
1. Spanish capability
2. Japanese capability
3. Make a back end // make the keyboard downloadable/a chrome extension?
4. Add on-theme images(?) to the left and right that disappear when the keyboard is minimized to a certain size
